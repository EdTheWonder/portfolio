Going into the experience I was quite nervous.\nI stuck to my guns and went with an idea that I had the past summer which was a website that helps students analyze their financial aid package based on information about the school, similar to how Niche.com grades colleges and universities.\nI ended up finding a partner who didn't know much about web development, but was willing to work with me in developing this idea.\nThis was my first foray into handling large amounts of data and trying to contextualize it for a user. If I were to fix one thing about the site, it would be effectively distinguishing the grades between each other so that a user's result is crystal clear.",
